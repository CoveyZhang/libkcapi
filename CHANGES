Changes 0.14.0
 * AIO: fix tracking of completed IOCBs
 * speed-test: fix AEAD handling
 * speed-test: fix time calculation
 * compiler now warns a user of deprecated API calls
 * AIO: handle kernel errors for algif_skcipher gracefully
 * AIO: using multiple IOCB if algif_aead interface supports it
 * ASYM: add PKCS1 tests
 * AIO: add ASYM AIO support
 * AIO: fix AEAD AIO fallback
 * AIO: add AIO fallback testing
 * replace enforcement of symmetric cipher limits with a log message only
   (the underlying kernel implementations should catch any errors)
 * add fuzzing tests
 * use autotools build system as provided by Georges Savoundararadj with
   additional considerations from Marcin Nowakowski (thanks a lot)
 * ALG_MAX_PAGES restriction is gone with current AF_ALG interface
 * add HKDF (RFC5869)
 * add apps/kcapi-rng
 * add support for multiple accepts where the caller maintains the opfd
 * fix memleak in error case in PBKDF
 * add multithreaded symmetric cipher tests
 * enable full AIO support for kernels 4.13 and higher (fallback AIO
   implementation using synchronous support for earlier kernels) -- this
   is due to the broken AIO support for earlier kernels
 * Add tests for the AAD copy operation to be supported for kernel 4.13

Changes 0.13.0
 * change kcapi_aead_encrypt_aio, kcapi_aead_decrypt_aio,
   kcapi_cipher_encrypt_aio and kcapi_cipher_decrypt_aio to require the
   user to provide IOVECs for input and output buffers separately
 * addition of kcapi_aead_inbuflen_enc, kcapi_aead_inbuflen_dec,
   kcapi_aead_outbuflen_enc, kcapi_aead_outbuflen_dec, kcapi_aead_getdata_input,
   kcapi_aead_getdata_output to allow apps to be programmed without specific
   code handling for old and new AEAD AF_ALG interface (AAD and tag handling).
   See the documentation section "AEAD Memory Structure" for an explanation
   on how to use the API in a way to make the calling application agnostic
   of the kernel interface differences.
 * significant addition to library to handle old / new AEAD AF_ALG interface
   without the caller being aware of that
 * change AEAD tests such to use the new API calls to make code independent
   of AEAD interface changes
 * split up of the library implementation into individual files to allow
   a more clear code management and to allow even to selectively disable
   code to make the library smaller
 * various small fixes suggested by Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek
 * fix memleak in kcapi_*_destroy suggested by Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek
 * use hard-links for the kcapi-hasher apps
 * add bi-arch tests
 * add check that AIO interface is only initialized if the kernel supports
   AIO (library requires kernel 4.1.0 or larger for skcipher AIO and
   4.7.0 or larger for AEAD AIO support)
 * add transparent fallback in case the caller requests AIO operation but
   the AIO interface was not or could not be initialized -- the AIO API can be
   used on systems without AIO support as the library transparently falls back
   to the non-AIO operation (however, the library complains at the beginning
   about the use of the AIO API on unsupported systems).

Changes 0.12.0
 * add version.lds
 * add KDF API
 * add PBKDF API
 * update Makefile to look for environment
 * bug fix speed test
 * add AIO support (this code is derived from the example code developed by
   Tadeusz Struk -- thanks a lot) together with AIO test cases
 * Move DSO_PUBLIC out of the public header file into the private header file
 * use _kcapi_cipher_crypt for AEAD operations - eliminate code duplication
 * update AEAD tests to verify that the kernel follows the memory and
   processing structure defined for in-kernel users. Note, the testing
   will assume the old AF_ALG interface handling up to and including 4.9.x.
   The new AF_ALG AEAD interface is assumed to be present starting with 4.10.0.
   Note, the interface differences are only visible in the return code of
   recv which is checked by the test cases. Otherwise, user space sees no
   difference.

Changes 0.11.1
 * move version information to kcapi.h to allow compile time tests for wrapping
   applications
 * fix error code path mem leaks in _kcapi_handle_init reported by cppcheck

Changes 0.11.0:
 * Convert all libkcapi data structures into opaque structures. This implies
   that the *_init functions require a reference to a pointer as these init
   functions now allocate the struct kcapi_handle data structure.
 * Add clean and consistent logging logic
 * fixed execution when CONFIG_CRYPTO_FIPS is disabled in kernel
 * mark all symbols except API as hidden
 * performance measurements for kcapi_md_updatn added
 * update speed tests for newer AVX/AVX2 kernel handling
 * update documentation to mark all parameters as [in] or [out]

Changes 0.10.2:
 * Fix kernel netlink parsing error message
 * doc: add hint for setting keys before sending data
 * fix compiler warnings about unsigned / signed comparisons

Changes 0.10.1:
 * Fix issues with the vmsplice usage in stream mode
 * Fix issues with the vmsplice usage in chunk mode
 * Any modification on the tfmfd must be performed before the accept() call as mandated
   by the update to kernel 4.4.
 * Add support for processing of arbitrary sized symmetric cipher input

Changes 0.10.0:
 * simplify kcapi_aead_encrypt and kcapi_aead_decrypt
 * comment out message truncation check
 * test.sh: fix RFC4106 IV handling for kernels >= 4.2 due to overhaul of
   AEAD support in the kernel
 * use zero-copy in stream operation if possible
 * Add set_pubkey API call
 * convert entire API to use data types with known sizes (i.e. stdint.h)
 * Add asymmetric tests to test.sh
 * Add asymmetric stream cipher API
 * update documentation to cover akcipher API

Changes 0.9.0:
 * Add asymmetric cipher API.

Changes 0.8.0:
 * Fix test.sh to invoke large AEAD test
 * All kcapi_*_destroy functions are void now
 * Update AEAD code to new kernel interface and update the AEAD API
 * Simplify the code for AEAD
 * Add and use kcapi_memset_secure
 * Add AIO logic
 * Add drop in replacements for sha1sum, sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum,
   sha512sum and md5sum
 * Remove the kernel-patch/ directory as its code is not consistent with
   the library any more. Use the current cryptodev-2.6 tree from Herbert Xu.

Change 0.7.2:
 * Move the library code into the directory lib/
 * Fix issues reported by cppcheck
 * AEAD: allow encrypt/decrypt invocations with NULL AAD and NULL PT/CT
 * AEAD: add test for NULL AAD and NULL PT/CT
 * RNG: always invoke seeding operation, even when seed is NULL

Change 0.7.1:
 * AEAD kernel interface is now upstreamed, reference the patches
   in the documentation appropriately and remove the patches from the
   kernel patch tree.
 * Test: add rfc4106(gcm(aes)) tests to general test and to speed test
 * Speed test: invoke the ciphers 10 times before time measurement to prime
   the caches.

Change 0.7.0:
 * AEAD kernel part does not relay MSG_TRUNC any more, thus using the
   read syscall is more efficient.
 * remove kcapi_cipher_setiv and add an IV parameter to all necessary
   API calls. This prevents the requirement for a function call
   and requiring the caller to maintain the IV buffer
 * add vmsplice tests to test framework to make sure vmsplice is really
   executed
 * fix documentation style
 * allow caller to specify which kernel interface (sendmsg / vmsplice)
   is used for one-shot API calls. This implies extension of one-shot
   API calls
 * Update stream API tests for AEAD to use 16 IOVECs to test the latest
   installment of the recvmsg interface of algif_aead

Change 0.6.5:
 * Measuring speed of vmsplice vs sendmsg interfaces and added heuristic
   to select the fastest implementation
 * Enhance documentation to explain usage of API better
 * added speed measuring tests in speed-test/
 * return errno for all syscalls through the API return codes
   for better error handling
 * process kernel flag of MSG_TRUNG for AEAD ciphers

Change 0.6.4:
 * Update AEAD interface patch
 * Add new test invoking cipher instance multiple times (-d flag of test
   application)

Change 0.6.3:
 * Remove several sanity checks in the API functions. This shall allow
   the invocation of edge conditions (like no plaintext, but AAD and tag).
   The kernel contains the appropriate sanity checks too. Therefore there
   is no harm in removing them.
 * Add testing of long AAD: fill 16 pages with 65504 bytes AAD and 32 bytes
   plaintext (stream API) and 15 pages AAD plus 16th page holding plaintext
   (one-shot API).
 * Update AEAD interface to allow arbitrary AAD sizes.

Change 0.6.2:
 * update all vmsplice invocations to consider the limitations of the pipe
   buffer of 16 pages (the limitation in the kernel is enforced by
   vmsplice_to_pipe setting nr_pages_max and splice_from_pipe_feed which
   iterates over the available pipe->nrbufs) - this fixes message digests and
   symmetric operations for input data larger than 16 pages; the AEAD
   cipher contains a sanity check that the input data size is not too large --
   thanks to Amit Uttamchandani <amit.uttam@gmail.com> for the bug report

 * Support for updated AEAD kernel interface
 * Use of NETLINK_CRYPTO instead of getsockopt (code currently disabled due to
   a bug in crypto/crypto_user.c -- see TODO)

Changes 0.2.1:
 * Add automation to generate nicely formatted guidance documents out of source
   code comments. See README.md for make targets generating the respective
   guidance documents.
