Changes 0.8.0:
 * Fix test.sh to invoke large AEAD test
 * all kcapi_*_destroy functions are void now
 * Update AEAD code to new kernel interface and update the AEAD API
 * Simplify the code for AEAD

Change 0.7.2:
 * Move the library code into the directory lib/
 * Fix issues reported by cppcheck
 * AEAD: allow encrypt/decrypt invocations with NULL AAD and NULL PT/CT
 * AEAD: add test for NULL AAD and NULL PT/CT
 * RNG: always invoke seeding operation, even when seed is NULL

Change 0.7.1:
 * AEAD kernel interface is now upstreamed, reference the patches
   in the documentation appropriately and remove the patches from the
   kernel patch tree.
 * Test: add rfc4106(gcm(aes)) tests to general test and to speed test
 * Speed test: invoke the ciphers 10 times before time measurement to prime
   the caches.

Change 0.7.0:
 * AEAD kernel part does not relay MSG_TRUNC any more, thus using the
   read syscall is more efficient.
 * remove kcapi_cipher_setiv and add an IV parameter to all necessary
   API calls. This prevents the requirement for a function call
   and requiring the caller to maintain the IV buffer
 * add vmsplice tests to test framework to make sure vmsplice is really
   executed
 * fix documentation style
 * allow caller to specify which kernel interface (sendmsg / vmsplice)
   is used for one-shot API calls. This implies extension of one-shot
   API calls
 * Update stream API tests for AEAD to use 16 IOVECs to test the latest
   installment of the recvmsg interface of algif_aead

Change 0.6.5:
 * Measuring speed of vmsplice vs sendmsg interfaces and added heuristic
   to select the fastest implementation
 * Enhance documentation to explain usage of API better
 * added speed measuring tests in speed-test/
 * return errno for all syscalls through the API return codes
   for better error handling
 * process kernel flag of MSG_TRUNG for AEAD ciphers

Change 0.6.4:
 * Update AEAD interface patch
 * Add new test invoking cipher instance multiple times (-d flag of test
   application)

Change 0.6.3:
 * Remove several sanity checks in the API functions. This shall allow
   the invocation of edge conditions (like no plaintext, but AAD and tag).
   The kernel contains the appropriate sanity checks too. Therefore there
   is no harm in removing them.
 * Add testing of long AAD: fill 16 pages with 65504 bytes AAD and 32 bytes
   plaintext (stream API) and 15 pages AAD plus 16th page holding plaintext
   (one-shot API).
 * Update AEAD interface to allow arbitrary AAD sizes.

Change 0.6.2:
 * update all vmsplice invocations to consider the limitations of the pipe
   buffer of 16 pages (the limitation in the kernel is enforced by
   vmsplice_to_pipe setting nr_pages_max and splice_from_pipe_feed which
   iterates over the available pipe->nrbufs) - this fixes message digests and
   symmetric operations for input data larger than 16 pages; the AEAD
   cipher contains a sanity check that the input data size is not too large --

 * update aead/rng kernel pages to match 3.19-rc1

Change 0.6.1:
 * fix compile error

Change 0.6.0:
 * add kcapi_md_blocksize
 * add stress / negative testing
 * add hint to NETLINK_CRYPTO patch requirement

Change 0.5.0:
 * kernel interface for AEAD and RNG changed
 * add kcapi_rng_seed API call

Change 0.4.0:
 * update AEAD cipher interface for current implemetation
 * remove nonalinged API
-* add one-shot and stream API
 * use zero copy interface for one-shot APi
 * add tests to cover one-shot and stream API
 * full documentation update
 * stress testing the library and the AEAD/RNG implementation

Change 0.3.0:
 * new kernel patch for AEAD/RNG interface
 * Support for updated AEAD kernel interface
 * Use of NETLINK_CRYPTO instead of getsockopt (code currently disabled due to
   a bug in crypto/crypto_user.c -- see TODO)

Changes 0.2.1:
 * Add automation to generate nicely formatted guidance documents out of source
   code comments. See README.md for make targets generating the respective
   guidance documents.

Changes 0.2.0:
 * Add kcapi_aead_[enc|dec]_* calls for non-aligned requests
 * Updated kernel patch to match what has been sent to LKML
 * Documentation of API calls and data structures completed
 * Add kcapi_md_digestsize
 * Add sanity checking to IV setting API
 * Add kcapi_pad_iv
 * Add sanity check around getsockopt wrapper API call
 * API documentation marks input / output parameters
 * API documentation explains AEAD decryption EBADMSG error code
 * Update of teets to cover all changed / new API calls
